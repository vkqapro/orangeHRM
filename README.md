This Testing Framework is designed to be intuitive, scalable, and easy to understand. It is built on the following principles and mechanisms:

* **AAA Pattern**: The framework follows the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern to structure test cases. Each test is divided into three clear phases:
  - **Arrange**: Set up the necessary preconditions and inputs.
  - **Act**: Perform the action or behavior being tested.
  - **Assert**: Verify that the expected outcome has occurred.

* **Page Object Model (POM)**: The framework implements the Page Object Model to enhance test maintainability and readability. It organizes methods into intuitive categories, such as:
  - **Navigation**: Methods to navigate to specific pages.
  - **Actions**: Methods to interact with page elements.
  - **Authentication**: Methods to log in as an Admin or User.

This structure allows you to write test scripts effortlessly, following the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach.
